# Intro to Lists 

- Strings are lists in Haskell
- Lists are a homogenous data structure
  - They store several elements of the same type 

- We can use the `let` keyword to define names in GHCI
  - Examples:
    - `let a = 1` is the same as writing `a = 1` in a script and then loading it 

- Lists are denoted by square brackets, and values in the list are seperated by commas

- Adding two lists together is done by using the `++` operator
  - Examples: 
    - `"Hello" ++ " " ++ "world"` ➡️ "Hello world"
    - `['w', 'o'] ++ ['o', 't']` ➡️ "woot"
